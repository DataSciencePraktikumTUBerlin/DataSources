# Project Data Sources and Data Sets

## Renewable Energy 
* **World Overview of Renewable Energy** https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy
	* Most of the information in this source comes from [BPStat review](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html) both in **.xlsx** and **.pdf**. For the first a *csv-type* manipulation won't be practical.
	* Other of their sources are too partial, or require payment (e.g. [WEO2020](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=WORLD&fuel=Energy%20supply&indicator=TPESbySource))
* **Misc Energy Datasets** https://openei.org/datasets/dataset?sectors=utilities&_sectors_limit=0
	* Propose to filter by Source and Year (e.g. **NREL & 2018** yields this [xlsm](https://data.nrel.gov/files/89/2018-ATB-data-interim-geo.xlsm))
	* Need to keep looking and define, togehter and according to the literature suggested, search tags.
* **Misc Energy Datasets by Country** https://energydata.info/dataset?vocab_topics=Renewable%20energy
	* The following file seems promising, [Global - Energy Statistics Yearbook](https://energydata.info/dataset/key-world-energy-statistics-enerdata). It's an **.xlsx**.
	* Same filtering/searching requirements as before.
* **Renewable Investment by Country 2004-2020** [Bloomberg Article](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/climate-change-data-green/investment.html), 
     [CSV Dataset](https://www.bloomberg.com/bbg-gfx/graphics-data/bgreen-dashboard/master/investment/investment.csv)
