# Proposed Data Sources:
First thanks for the links and the time invested finding them. I am going over them, first only *superficially*, in order to asses the convenience and direct value in each of them, if we planned to use the data they offer. From that preliminary evaluation, I am posting here a **priority index** = **[Pr]** and leaving a short comment on its content. This index goes from 1 to 5, according to my judgenmt on *how useful and directly applicable* the information contained in the link is, regarding our current research question and its evetual operationalization. Needless to say, that is only my opinion and if anyone finds some value not to correspond we can readily discuss it.

*Same as the third*

https://energydata.info/dataset/world-global-tracking-framework-2017
**Pr = 5**
**Comment:** This Dataset includes indicators as we presumably need fo our work. It has a reliable source and more than one institution reporting the data. In particular [this view](https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/time) shows the kind of indicators and their change in time, that would be usefull for our correlation exercise.

https://energydata.info/dataset/world-regulatory-indicators-sustainable-energy-2016
**Pr = 4**
**Comment:** Has the same advantages of the last one, but seem to offer a shorter time span and the the same/fewer institutions as supporters. Could be maybe used to controlled the data from the oher source, if not find to be the same exact set. As disadvantage it has only *.xlsx* file format.

https://energydata.info/dataset/climatescope-mapping-the-global-frontiers-for-clean-energy-investment-2017
**Pr = 4**
**Comment:** Techno-financial context is taken into account. Only for a couple years. couldnt get the preview of the data

https://energydata.info/dataset/world-solar-irradiation-and-pv-power-potential-map
**Pr = 2**
**Comment:**

https://energydata.info/dataset/world-wind-speed-and-wind-power-potential-maps
**Pr = 2**
**Comment:**

https://energydata.info/dataset/world-solar-stations-inventory-2017
**Pr = 3**
**Comment:** Too focused on on e energy technology. Could not find a time series or trend. Pros: It is up to date and its been updated regularly, convenient format (.csv)

https://energydata.info/dataset/selected-countries-geothermal-investments-2016
**Pr = 3**
**Comment:** Again too explicitly orientated, in this case to Geothermal. Which would be actually an advantage if we had the time and expertise to produce an extensive research for some specific renewables. Pro's: Very comfortable format (.csv) and extensive time range (since 1970), although only for certain countries.

https://energydata.info/dataset/global-photovoltaic-power-potential-by-country
**Pr = 2**
**Comment:** It is explicitly orientated to the Photovoltaic, which may be too one-sided if we don't find equivalent sources for other renewables. The size of the files is considerable (5.3 GB) and its formate forces to be downloaded as a whole (.zip). Pro's: is recent (2020) and Solaga seems to be an interesting data provider.

# Question from Guillermo:
```diff
- Why do we think there is a correlation between investments and engineering?
```
R/ Because public reports in enhanced tehnical charateristics, e.g. increased *Energy conversion efficiency*, or government desicions on Energy affairs, e.g. *Asset investment in renewalbes*, represent relevant information for the investors to decide wehter or not to invest in this technologies and the companies behind them. Or at least that would be the logical chain of reasoning. On the other hand it may be more a matter of trust and social perception. That would be a main conclusion of our work.
